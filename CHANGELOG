CHANGELOG
===============

from 0.3.1 (2007/04/26)
-----------------------
* fixed a typo in ie6specific.css and ie5specific.css that caused a display
	problem in IE 6. Tested fix in IE 6.  Not tested in IE 5--IE 5
	specific CSS should be removed soon.

from 0.2.11 to 0.3.0 (2007/04/23)
-----------------------------------
* add getACLAccess which is a function that does a call to
	"fs getcalleraccess" to find which permissions the user has been
	granted. Track which privileges the user has been granted, and adjust
	choices in display appropriately. Don't display checkbox column
	if there are no appropriate choices for the current directory.

	This replaces the old viewable, readable, writable privilege
	checks with privilege-specific variables ( admin, delete,
	insert, lookup, read, write ).

	An interesting note to this: deleting a file or directory requires
	lookup, delete, write and either read or insert privileges. However,
	in order to move a file out of a directory, you only need read,
	lookup and delete.

* disable the checkboxes for current and parent directories, to avoid the
	risk that the user may delete or cut one of those directories

* remove link to file when it's empty

* removed readOnlyPath and notIgnore, since AFS ACLs are properly obeyed

* fix file upload progress bar

* simplify construction of current path in php/libdrawers.php

* remove mention of native openafs client on public "splash page"

* change some if ( ! $variable ) statements to if ( empty( $variable ))

* adjust whitespace indents in changed files to be more standardized

* adjust wrap points for long lines in changed files to be more readable

* adjust whitespace around parentheses to be more standard


from 0.2.10 to 0.2.11 (2007/03/29)
-----------------------------------
js/filemanage.js:
* more precise file sizes in formatBytes 

* add features for image previews in list view. However, this code isn't
	implemented the way we would like it, so it's commented out for now.

* more consistent use of whitespace and formatting
	(more needs to be done across the app)

* add readOnlyPath for backup directories and other special cases

libcgi/cgi.c:
* change from read to fread to fix premature end of read when data is binary

* clobber old file before copying new one into place when doing an overwrite.
	This is a fix for the problem where small files doesn't
	properly overwrite large ones

smarty/sidebar.tpl:
* change sidebar from class to id tag

* alter presentation of file upload progress
	The progress bar now appears, but still doesn't seem to update

* add changelog
