Suggested Features/bugfixes for trouser.

- Add a link to a "delegate afs permissions" url to the mfile menu.

- Create a "delegate afs permissions" page.

    This will be a separate url.

    This url may be under the "help" section of the mfile page.

    Upon loading, this url will make an ldap lookup of the user's affiliation.

    The body of the page will consist of a list of AFS groups
    that the user may delegate folder permissions to. At the top
    of the list (highlighted?) will be the "suggested" group,
    based on the user's affiliation.

    Each listing will include a status icon, showing whether
    the group currently has recursive permissions to access the
    user's folder.

    Each listing will feature an "give permission" or "remove permission"
    button which will recursively add or remove group permissions
    from that user's AFS directories.

    Add a marking (icon) which shows groups that the user has delegated
    permissions to but is no longer affilliated with.

- Add "help" button to mfile header.
    Add "help" button and a corresponding documentation page.

    Documentation exists. "Online documentation" from mfile main page.

    Use the mfile look and feel to link to the various mfile
    documentation pages.

- Fix mfile header
    Change mfile header so that it "lines up" exactly with
    the non-ssl mfile login page. Right now it's looking a bit odd.

- Integrate archive file access into mfile

    There be an "open archive" file menu option that
    lights up when an archive is selected. Clicking
    on this option brings up a tab that will allow the following selections:

    expand contents in current folder
    expand contents in folder named "Blah"
    expand contents in arbitrary folder (entered by form below)

    when a folder is clicked on, the option should be added to the
    context-sensitive menu to "turn this folder into an archive"

    "Create an archive out of selected items" would probably
    be the better interface.

- Fix the "rename" function
    In file rename, fix it so that hitting the return key completes
    the rename instead of having to hit the "rename" button.

- Fix cutting and pasting into the same folder.

    Currently, this doesn't work. A possible solution would be to
    create a copy, prefaced with "copy of" or simply numbered.

- Fix the handling of uploading an existing file.
    The current implementation doesn't allow the "clobbering" of an existing
    file and simply fails.

    A pop-up box should give you the option to perform the clobber.

    A fancier option would give you a checkbox to "remember these
    settings", but remembering the settings would require some
    sort of ".mfile" file kept in the users AFS space.

- Add handling for "current folder" operations.

    We'll need cut, copy, rename, and set permissions for current folder.

    Three ways of doing this:

    1. Add 4 separate links to the the file menu:
	Cut current folder
	Copy current folder
	Rename current folder
	Set permissions for current folder

    2. Add a checkbox next to the large folder icon at the
       top of the menu items, and link this to the file operations when
       selected.

       THIS IS PREFERRED.

    3. Add a "this folder" entry to the existing checklist. Ensure
       that it always remains on top when sorted.

- Modify behavior of download filename and icon.

    The filename link should simply be a "normal" download link.

    The icon should be the "force-download" header that's currently
    in place.

    Should these actions be sensitive to the files mime type?

    Other button should just be an a-link to the object in question.
    Open in new window? .mfile saved preferences?

- Add an AFS quota display button?

    Display quota at all times.
    Add a "buy more quota" link next to the displayed quota.

- Re-work permissions tab for usability
    Permissions tab is currently very confusing unless you're
    familiar with AFS "wildkar" rights and how those work.

    Make the permissions tab a list of users/groups
    with a simple drop-down menu selection. We'd like
    to simplify folder and file rights to a few simple
    choices. Advanced choices will still be available
    in another tab.

    something like below (subject to change):

    Groups Blah may: "see this folder when browsing"
                     "see the contents of this folder"
                     "change and/or delete this folder"

    User Blah may:  "see this folder when browsing"
                    "see the contents of this folder"
                    "change and/or delete this folder"

    In this display make abbreviations ike "Group system:anyuser" to Anyone,
    to make permissions a little easier to understand.

    Possibly make current permission tab features available in an
    "advanced" or "advanced AFS management" sub-tab.

- Possibly allow the creation maintenance of a "friends" afs list?
    and then allow the display of "My friends may:" etc?

- Dropbox

    Single button labeled sharing, or dropboxes.

    Allow you to find anyplace that has sharing access for you.

    Will make a list of all the folders that are set up to be deliberately
    shared with you, or groups that you are a member of.

    This will be maintained by some form of database, which will keep
    track of these relationships.

    It's OK for this database to lose consistency when the filespace
    is editted manually.

    Give each "dropbox" folder read access lookup permissions
    for group

    the "difficult" part is coming up with a simple ui

    browse as "mfile", with a friend user piece of text.

    "dropbox" directories will have permissions to an mfile group (or
    user)

- Fix Sort files without regard to upper and lower case. (case insensitive)

- Fix add secondary key (filename, alphabetical) to sort fields when
    sorting by something else other than filename.

- We want to have a text-editing feature for MIME types that would be
    editable in a web window.

- Integration with mprint context sensitive "print this file"

- Integration with mail.umich.edu (imp)... context sensitive "mail this
    file as an attachment"

- Integrate mail.umich.edu (imp?) to be able to save read attachments as
    uploaded files.

- Fix incompatible browser detection needs to be added. Right now
    older browers (IE 5 on mac, for example) display garbled tables.

- Add some sort of file (or full directory) synchronization. This could
    be interactive, based on timestamp. Would it handle merges? Warn
    between changes?

    "you're about to replace an older version of ..."

- There should be some way in the "web sites" view to get the web-url of
    any given document. Possibly add a url link into the information bar
    of a given file/directory?

- Fix Makefile.in so that it correctly configures php and javascript
    headers to use the configuration strings created in ./configure.

- Fix Makefile.in so that ./configure and Make no longer have to recursively
    go into the upload directory to make upload.cgi... everything should
    be done from the root.
