(0.2) --- Bugs & Security (a)

- Either make the code XHTML compliant, or HTML compliant

- Change makefile so that an install only changes files that actually
  have changes, instead of updating all timestamps
  (for ease of radmind transcript creation)

- Fix the "rename" function
	In file rename, fix it so that hitting the return key completes
	the rename instead of having to hit the "rename" button.

- Fix cutting and pasting into the same folder.

	Currently, this doesn't work. A possible solution would be to
	create a copy, prefaced with "copy of" or simply numbered.

- Fix when a single item is selected, display the large mime icon for that item
	under "selected item properties"

(0.3) --- LS&A Permissions Feature

- Feature Add handling for "current folder" operations.

	We'll need cut, copy, rename, and set permissions for current folder.

	Three ways of doing this:

	1. Add 4 separate links to the the file menu:
	Cut current folder
	Copy current folder
	Rename current folder
	Set permissions for current folder

	2. Add a checkbox next to the large folder icon at the
	   top of the menu items, and link this to the file operations when
	   selected.

	   THIS IS PREFERRED.

	3. Add a "this folder" entry to the existing checklist. Ensure
	   that it always remains on top when sorted.

- Feature: Re-work permissions tab for usability
	Permissions tab is currently very confusing unless you're
	familiar with AFS "wildkar" rights and how those work.

	Make the permissions tab a list of users/groups
	with a simple drop-down menu selection. We'd like
	to simplify folder and file rights to a few simple
	choices. Advanced choices will still be available
	in another tab.

	something like below (subject to change):

	Groups Blah may: "see this folder when browsing"
					 "see the contents of this folder"
					 "change and/or delete this folder"

	User Blah may:  "see this folder when browsing"
					"see the contents of this folder"
					"change and/or delete this folder"

	In this display make abbreviations like "Group system:anyuser" to Anyone,
	to make permissions a little easier to understand.

	Possibly make current permission tab features available in an
	"advanced" or "advanced AFS management" sub-tab.

--- Non-critical Fixes

- Fix mfile header
	Change mfile header so that it "lines up" exactly with
	the non-ssl mfile login page. Right now it's looking a bit odd.

- Fix Sort files without regard to upper and lower case. (case insensitive)

- Fix add secondary sort key (filename, alphabetical) to sort fields when
	sorting by something else other than filename.

--- Web Stuff

- Feature There should be some way in the "web sites" view to get
	the web-url of any given document. Possibly add a url link into
	the information bar of a given file/directory?

- Feature: view/click/download links for documents
	in webspace: display link, view inline, download
	in non-webspace: view inline, download

--- Minor UI enhancements

- Feature interact with ABS to display when an account has been disabled.
   We don't want users who have AFS access disabled poking around on
   mfile and not seeing their home directory.

- Feature if you don't have a home directory, bring up a page/link
   that says something like "you do not have an IFS home directory
   either one was never created for you, or it's been disabled."
   Then provide a link to where they can get help.

--- Major Features

- Feature Possibly allow the creation/maintenance of a "friends" afs list?
	and then allow the display of "My friends may:" etc?

- Feature Integrate archive file access into mfile

	There be an "open archive" file menu option that
	lights up when an archive is selected. Clicking
	on this option brings up a tab that will allow the following selections:

	expand contents in current folder
	expand contents in folder named "Blah"
	expand contents in arbitrary folder (entered by form below)

	when a folder is clicked on, the option should be added to the
	context-sensitive menu to "turn this folder into an archive"

	"Create an archive out of selected items" would probably
	be the better interface.

- Feature Add an AFS quota display button?

	Display quota at all times.
	Add a "buy more quota" link next to the displayed quota.

	https://accounts.www.umich.edu/umce-bin/umce

	(current IFS quota display)

- Feature Dropbox

	Single button labeled sharing, or dropboxes.

	Allow you to find anyplace that has sharing access for you.

	Will make a list of all the folders that are set up to be deliberately
	shared with you, or groups that you are a member of.

	This will be maintained by some form of database, which will keep
	track of these relationships.

	It's OK for this database to lose consistency when the filespace
	is editted manually.

	Give each "dropbox" folder read access lookup permissions
	for group

	the "difficult" part is coming up with a simple ui

	browse as "mfile", with a friend user piece of text.

	"dropbox" directories will have permissions to an mfile group (or
	user)

- Feature Create want to have a text-editing feature for MIME types
	that would be editable in a web window.

--- Inter-Application Communication:

- Feature Integration with mprint context sensitive "print this file"

- Feature Integration with mail.umich.edu (imp)... context sensitive
	"mail this file as an attachment"

- Feature Integrate mail.umich.edu (imp?) to be able to save read
	attachments as uploaded files.

--- Release

- Feature find total # of users ever.
	Look for how many new users we get every week.
	(willn)

- Feature: restructure Favorite Locations to "Shared Locations"
	* make Favorites directory a special virtual directory (dotfile)
	* store favorites, group spaces, dropboxes, and shared
	* Get rid of the concept of having an actual "favorites" folder stored in
	the user's AFS space. Create new, easily identified virtual folders that
	may have additional, context-sensitive options that would be displayed in
	the left-hand bar. These folders will eventually include favorites, groups,
	shared and dropboxes
	* Add an "add this folder as a favorite" link as a context-sensitive action.
	* store list of places that someone else has permitted to a user in a database (both for umich users as well as friends)

- Feature: check to see the user's account has been disabled. This may
	be listed in the itua:see_us, itd.login:suspension_x (x == first letter
	of uniqname), or itd.umich:filesys.denied 
	Please see: ~itd/fceiaa/project/disableuser/README
