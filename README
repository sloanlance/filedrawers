Quick instructions for installing filedrawers

More detailed instructions
--------------------------

1: Getting the source

Download the source from http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/filedrawers and
uncompress it into a build directory of your liking. The build directory
should be different from your install directory.  The current development
source is also available through an anonymous CVS server.

2: Configure the software

Using configure in the top level of your build directory, configure the
software for your system:

  % ./configure

The configure scripts take several options.  To see them, run:

  % ./configure --help

The following options were used to configure the build of filedrawers
at http://mfile.umich.edu, which installs filedrawers into
/usr/local/projects/mfile on the webserver.

./configure \
--prefix=/usr/local/projects \
--with-project_name=mfile \
--with-service_name="mfile.umich.edu" \
--with-service_url="http://mfile.umich.edu" \
--with-secure_service_url="https://mfile.umich.edu" \
--with-error_url="https://mfile.umich.edu/?error=true" \
--with-install_group=staff
--with-sdb_host='' \
--with-sdb_name='mfile' \
--with-sdb_ro_user='mfile' \
--with-sdb_ro_password=''

The following options were use to configure the build of filedrawers
at http://mfile-dev.www.umich.edu:

./configure \
--prefix=/usr/local/projects \
--with-project_name=mfile-dev \
--with-service_name="mfile-dev.umich.edu" \
--with-service_url="http://mfile-dev.www.umich.edu" \
--with-secure_service_url="https://mfile-dev.www.umich.edu" \
--with-error_url="https://mfile-dev.www.umich.edu/?error=true" \
--with-install_group=staff \
--with-sdb_host='' \
--with-sdb_name='mfile' \
--with-sdb_ro_user='mfile' \
--with-sdb_ro_password=''

3: Build and install the software

Clean out any options from previous installations by running:

  % make clean

Now you are ready to build the software. From the top level of your
build directory:

  % make

Once that is done, you can install the service into the directory
you configured with ./configure.

  # make install

4: Configure apache aliases

Filedrawers is normally configured as two separate document roots, the
ssl document root (default name: html-ssl) and the non-ssl document root
(default name: html).

The parent directory of these document roots (default name: filedrawers)
contain several directories that contain common components for the
document root directories. These directories are:

    images   - contains site images
    lib      - contains php non-object library functions
    objects  - contains php objects
    js       - contains javascript
    smarty   - directory containing smarty templates and configuration

All references to these directories within filedrawers php and html code
are done as absolute references (/images for the images directory, for example).

To make this work, it will be necessary to add Alias directives under your
apache filedrawers configuration for the following directories:
    images
    js
    css

For example... if you used ./configure to configure an installation
prefix of "/usr/local/projects" with the default project name of
"filedrawers" then you'd add the following lines to your filedrawers
apache configuration file:

    Alias /images/ /usr/local/projects/filedrawers/images/
    Alias /js/ /usr/local/projects/filedrawers/js/
    Alias /css/ /usr/local/projects/filedrawers/css/

You'll also need to add the following directories to the php include path.
    lib
    objects
    smarty

This is done by adding a "php_value" line to your apache filedrawers
configuration.

For example... if you used ./configure to configure an installation prefix
of '/usr/local/projects' with the default project name of "filedrawers"
and a php include directory of '/usr/lib/php' then you'd add the following
line to your filedrawers apache configuration file:

php_value include_path .:/usr/lib/php:/usr/local/projects/filedrawers/lib:
/usr/local/projects/filedrawers/objects:/usr/local/projects/filedrawers/smarty
