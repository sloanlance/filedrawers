More detailed instructions
--------------------------

1: Getting the source

Download the source from http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/trouser and
uncompress it into a directory of your liking.  The current development
source is also available through an anonymous CVS server.

2: Configure the software

Using configure in the top level directory, configure the software for
your system:

  % ./configure

The configure scripts take several options.  To see them, run:

  %s ./configure --help

The following options were used to configure the build of trouser
at http://mfile.umich.edu:

    --prefix=/usr/local/projects
    --with-project_name=mfile
    --with-error_url="https://mfile-dev.www.umich.edu/?error=true"

3: Build and install the software

Now you are ready to build the software

  % make

Once that is done, you can install the service into the directory
you configured with ./configure.

  # make install
