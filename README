More detailed instructions
--------------------------

1: Getting the source

Download the source from http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/trouser and
uncompress it into a build directory of your liking. The build directory
should be different from your install directory.  The current development
source is also available through an anonymous CVS server.

2: Configure the software

Using configure in the top level of your build directory, configure the
software for your system:

  % ./configure

The configure scripts take several options.  To see them, run:

  % ./configure --help

The following options were used to configure the build of trouser
at http://mfile.umich.edu, which installs trouser into
/usr/local/projects/mfile on the webserver.

./configure \
--prefix=/usr/local/projects \
--with-project_name=mfile \
--with-service_name="mfile.umich.edu" \
--with-service_url="http://mfile.umich.edu" \
--with-secure_service_url="https://mfile.umich.edu" \
--with-error_url="https://mfile.umich.edu/?error=true" \
--with-install_group=staff

The following options were use to configure the build of trouser
at http://mfile-dev.www.umich.edu:

./configure \
--prefix=/usr/local/projects \
--with-project_name=mfile-dev \
--with-service_name="mfile-dev.umich.edu" \
--with-service_url="http://mfile-dev.www.umich.edu" \
--with-secure_service_url="https://mfile-dev.www.umich.edu" \
--with-error_url="https://mfile-dev.www.umich.edu/?error=true" \
--with-install_group=staff

3: Build and install the software

Now you are ready to build the software. From the top level of your
build directory:

  % make

Once that is done, you can install the service into the directory
you configured with ./configure.

  # make install
